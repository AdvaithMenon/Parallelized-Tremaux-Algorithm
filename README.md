# Parallelized-Tremaux-Algorithm
A parallelized version of the tremaux algorithm to solve mazes.

This version uses a shared memory parallel programming model using java threads where each thread searches through the maze using the Serial Tremaux Algorithm.

When two threads meet, they combine their search spaces.
